About This Document
--------------------
Good documentation is more important than code development. One of the features of a good document is the ability to track its changes.
So we used a very popular tool called `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ which enables us to write our documents in a markup language such as
`reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ or `Markdown <https://commonmark.org>`_ and generate very beautiful and structured HTML or PDF outputs.

This document is written in such a way to make the code development and documentation as fast as possible and present the future developers a very readable and easy to understand material.
